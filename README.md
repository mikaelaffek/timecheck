# Timetjek - Time Tracking Application

A modern time tracking application built with Laravel 11 and Vue 3.

## Features

- **Correct Working Hours**: Easily correct registered working hours with a few clicks. Fix clock-in/out times and breaks.
- **Show Deviations from Schedule**: Timetjek clearly shows if a time registration differs from scheduled work shifts. Administrators can choose whether this should be corrected automatically, manually by staff or administrators, or if you want to be notified of the deviation.
- **Overtime Rules**: You decide if and which overtime rules apply to your staff, and these can automatically be included in the staff's salary documentation if desired.
- **Export Time Reports and Staff Registry**: Download time reports containing all working hours for all staff in PDF or Excel format. Export a complete staff registry to send to the Tax Agency during workplace inspections.
- **User Management**: Add and manage users with different permission levels
- **Mobile Responsive**: Access from any device
